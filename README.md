### Sentiment Classification with Hierarchical Attention
In this notebook I train a sentiment classification model with a GRU model. I also add an attention layer so as to visualize what the model is learnining and considers important for sentiment classification. Code adapted from [here](https://github.com/ilivans/tf-rnn-attention) (thanks to the author for releasing his thesis code). Attention is inspired by this [paper](http://www.aclweb.org/anthology/N16-1174).
